1. What are the differences between mutating array methods and non-mutation array methods in JavaScript. List 5 array methods that fall under each of them.

   ## Ans:

   - In JavaScript, arrays have a number of built-in methods that can be used to modify and manipulate their contents. These methods can be broadly categorized into two types: mutating array methods and non-mutating array methods.

   - Mutating array methods modify the original array, while non-mutating array methods return a new array without modifying the original.

   - Here are 5 examples of each:

   - Mutating array methods:

   a. push(): Adds one or more elements to the end of the array and returns the new length of the array.
   b. pop(): Removes the last element from the array and returns it.
   c. splice(): Changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.
   d. reverse(): Reverses the order of the elements in the array.
   e. sort(): Sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array.

   - Non-mutating array methods:

   a. slice(): Returns a new array containing a copy of a portion of the original array.
   b. concat(): Returns a new array that combines two or more arrays.
   c. filter(): Returns a new array containing all elements that pass a certain test.
   d. map(): Returns a new array containing the results of calling a function on each element in the original array.
   e. reduce(): Applies a function to each element in an array to reduce it to a single value, and returns that value.
